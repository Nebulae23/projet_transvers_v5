# Nightfall Defenders: Enhanced Edition - System Design

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Procedural Skill System
- Use component-based skill generation system with modular parts
- Implement skill template system for class-specific constraints
- Utilize existing particle system for visual effects
- Integration with Paragon level system for unlocks

### 2. Enhanced Class Skills
- Template-based skill definition system
- Branch evolution tracking system
- Visual effect composition system
- Resource management integration

### 3. Dynamic Menu System
- Implement scene graph for camera control
- World snapshot system for save preview
- Event scheduling system for special effects
- Environment state machine for transitions

### 4. Advanced Visual Effects
- Implement screen-space reflections for water
- Use volumetric rendering for clouds
- Particle system extensions for aurora and weather
- Dynamic lighting system improvements

### 5. World Generation
- Enhanced noise-based terrain generation
- Biome transition system using weight maps
- Object placement using constraint solving
- Dynamic detail map generation

## Data Structures and Interfaces

### Skill System Classes
See improvements_class_diagram.mermaid for detailed class structure including:
- SkillGenerator
- SkillTemplate
- SkillModifier
- SkillComponent
- ClassSkillManager

### Visual System Classes
See improvements_class_diagram.mermaid for detailed class structure including:
- MenuCamera
- WorldRenderer
- EffectSystem
- TerrainGenerator

## Program Call Flow
See improvements_sequence_diagram.mermaid for detailed sequence diagrams including:
- Skill Generation Flow
- Menu Camera Control Flow
- Visual Effect Pipeline Flow
- World Generation Flow

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement LOD system for menu scene
- Use GPU instancing for vegetation
- Implement effect pooling system
- Use async loading for world generation

### Memory Management
- Texture streaming for large landscapes
- Effect instance pooling
- Dynamic resource loading/unloading
- Cached world generation results

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Maximum number of concurrent procedural skills
2. Specific performance requirements for low-end systems
3. Exact formula for skill scaling with Paragon levels
4. Weather event transition timing in menu
