# Advanced Graphics System PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Name
advanced_graphics_system

### 1.2 Requirements Background
To enhance the visual quality and performance of the game through implementation of modern graphics features including HDR rendering, PBR materials, and GPU-accelerated particle systems.

### 1.3 Original Requirements
- Implement HDR rendering and post-processing pipeline
- Create PBR materials system with dynamic weathering
- Develop GPU-accelerated particle system

## 2. Product Goals

1. Achieve photorealistic rendering quality while maintaining 60+ FPS on target hardware
2. Implement industry-standard PBR workflow for consistent material appearance
3. Support large-scale particle effects without impacting performance

## 3. User Stories

1. As a player, I want to experience realistic lighting and HDR effects so that the game world feels more immersive
2. As an artist, I want a standardized PBR workflow so that materials look consistent across different lighting conditions
3. As a player, I want to see complex particle effects during combat and environmental interactions so that the game feels more dynamic
4. As a developer, I want efficient graphics systems so that the game maintains high performance

## 4. Competitive Analysis

Product Comparison:

1. Unreal Engine 5

3. Godot 4
- Pros: Open source, lightweight, Vulkan support
- Cons: Limited advanced features, smaller ecosystem

4. CryEngine
- Pros: Advanced lighting, established PBR pipeline
- Cons: Resource intensive, steep learning curve

5. Custom AAA Game Engines (Frostbite, RE Engine)
- Pros: Highly optimized, cutting-edge features
- Cons: Proprietary, unavailable for general use
