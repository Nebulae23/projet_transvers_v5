# Nightfall Defenders: Enhanced Edition PRD

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Original Requirements
Enhance the endgame content and visual quality of Nightfall Defenders with:
- Procedural skill generation system
- Enhanced class-based skill system
- Dynamic main menu with environmental showcase
- Advanced visual effects and world generation

### 1.2 Development Stack
- Game Engine: Current engine with HD-2D pipeline
- Programming Language: Current implementation
- Visual Style: Enhanced HD-2D (Octopath Traveler style)

## 2. Enhanced Skill System

### 2.1 Principal Skills (P0)
- Each class MUST have 6 distinctive principal skills
- Skills MUST follow the evolution path described in original PRD
- Each principal skill MUST have 3 evolution branches

#### Example for Warrior Class
1. Blade Storm
   - Branch A: Tornado Blade (AoE focus)
   - Branch B: Precision Strike (Single target)
   - Branch C: Endless Slashes (Multi-hit)

2. Shield Wall
   - Branch A: Reflective Barrier
   - Branch B: Mobile Fortress
   - Branch C: Energy Shield

[Similar structure for remaining 4 skills]

### 2.2 Procedural Skill Generation (P0)

#### Activation Requirements
- MUST unlock after reaching max level (50)
- MUST be tied to Paragon system progression

#### Generation Rules
1. Base Components
   - Skill Type (Attack, Defense, Utility)
   - Element (Fire, Ice, Lightning, etc.)
   - Delivery Method (Projectile, AoE, Buff, etc.)

2. Modifier System
   - Primary Modifier (Changes core behavior)
   - Secondary Modifier (Adds effects)
   - Scaling Modifier (Affects numbers)

3. Class Restrictions
   - Generated skills MUST align with class theme
   - MUST respect class resource systems
   - MAY combine elements from different classes

#### Example Generation
Warrior Procedural Skill:
```
Base: Attack Skill
Element: Fire
Delivery: Sweep
Primary: Echoing (Repeats 3 times)
Secondary: Burning (DoT effect)
Scaling: Increases with Strength
```

## 3. Dynamic Main Menu

## 8. Open Questions
1. Should procedural skills have a maximum generation limit?
2. How should weather events be distributed in the main menu?
3. What are the minimum hardware requirements for enhanced visuals?
4. How will the procedural skill system scale with future content?

## 9. Success Metrics
1. Player engagement with procedural skills
2. Time spent in endgame content
3. Visual satisfaction ratings
4. Performance metrics on target platforms
