# Nightfall Defenders - System Design

## Implementation Approach

### Core Technologies
- Python 3.8+ as the main programming language
- PyOpenGL for graphics rendering
- NumPy for mathematical operations and physics calculations
- Pillow for texture loading
- PyGame for window management and input handling

### Key Implementation Challenges
1. Custom Physics Engine
   - Verlet integration for organic animations
   - Collision detection system
   - Trajectory calculation for projectiles

2. Rendering Performance
   - Sprite batching for efficient rendering
   - Deferred rendering for lighting effects
   - Particle system optimization

3. Game State Management
   - Day/night cycle synchronization
   - Entity component system
   - Resource management

### Open Source Libraries
- PyOpenGL: Core graphics rendering
- NumPy: Mathematical computations
- Pillow: Image loading
- PyGame: Window and input management
- json: Save game data serialization

## Data Structures and Interfaces
See class diagram in separate file.

## Program Call Flow
See sequence diagram in separate file.

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Specific visual effects requirements for abilities - will need to define exact shader requirements
2. Performance targets for minimum hardware specifications
3. Details of save game format and compression requirements
4. Networking requirements for future multiplayer support if planned
