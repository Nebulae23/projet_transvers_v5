# Project Summary
"Nightfall Defenders" is an immersive RPG game project designed to provide a captivating gameplay experience through a sophisticated game engine. The game includes engaging mechanics such as physics, combat systems, and a dynamic day/night cycle. Recent enhancements feature a procedural skill generation system for post-level-50 characters, an advanced class-based skill system with unique skills, and a cinematic main menu. The project emphasizes high visual quality with an HD-2D art style and advanced environmental effects, aiming to create an expansive and interactive game world.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules, including:
- **Graphics System**: Implements HD-2D rendering with advanced shaders and effects.
- **Physics System**: Implements Verlet physics for organic animations.
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Manages game objects and their behaviors.
- **Combat System**: Handles trajectory-based abilities and combat mechanics.
- **Day/Night Cycle System**: Manages time progression, light levels, and enemy spawn rates.
- **Weather System**: Integrates particle effects for rain and storms, impacting gameplay mechanics.
- **UI/HUD System**: Provides visual elements for player interaction.
- **Inventory System**: Manages item collection and equipment.
- **Player Progression System**: Tracks player experience and statistics, including procedural skill generation.
- **City Management System**: Manages district placements, buildings, and resources.
- **Open World and Quest System**: Facilitates terrain generation, quest management, and NPC interactions.
- **Sound System**: Integrates dynamic music and spatial audio.
- **Menu System**: Dynamic main menu with POV camera showcasing the game world.
- **Additional Systems**: Includes tutorials, achievements, and random events.
